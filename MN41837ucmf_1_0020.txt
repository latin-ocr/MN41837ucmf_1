To the Reader.

The tert presented in this book is substantially that of the first
edition of J acob ben Ghayim's Massoretic Recension printed by Bom-
berg in Venice in 1524-25. During his long study of the sacred text,
Dr. O. D. Ginsburg has collated this famous edition with orer seventy
Biblical MSS. and nineteen editions printed prior to J acob ben Cheyirn.
Most of these belong to the unique collection iu the Britishhluseurn7whose
authorities hare hindly rendered the present editor every assistance.
Each MS. and early edition specified in the accompanying list has
been oar-efully collated for rariations in orthography, vowel points,
accents and sectional divisions. The notes at the foot of each page
embody the principa] results of this collation and record in detail
the source of each variatiou.

The list of MSS„ early editions and ancient Versions specifies
the Hebrew letter by which each is quoted in the footnotes. The
ancient Versions are referred to only when they agree with a reading
of the MSS. or with a probable conjecture.

The services of Professor Nestle, Ι. Ι. Kahan and Dr. W. Aldis
Wright‚ who hare helped in the prees-reading, and of the Rev.
H. E. Hohnes, Dr. Ginsburg's amanuensis⁷ are acknowledged with
gratitudo. Special thanhs are dueto Professor Nestle for his careful
collation of Dr. Ginsburg's first edition from Jereniiah onward with
the first edition of Jacob beu Ohayinr, to Ι. l. Kahau for many valuahle
suggestions, and to Dr. W. Aldis Wright for his collation of the
references to the ancient Versions.

This edition of the Hebrew Bible is issued by the Eritish and
